---

### 📌 **4. Question Display Page**

**Command:**

> On the page `/study/:mode/category/:categoryId/subtopic/:subtopicId/questions`, display questions one by one based on the current logic already implemented in your app for study mode (Review, Practice, or Quiz).

## ✅ What You’re Not Changing

* ✅ The logic for question handling.
* ✅ The structure of your categories/subtopics/questions.
* ✅ The data structure or back-end.

## ✅ Bonus UI Suggestions:

If using React or a component-based system, structure your routes and components like:

```
/components
  └─ StudyModeSelection.jsx
  └─ CategorySelection.jsx
  └─ SubtopicSelection.jsx
  └─ QuestionDisplay.jsx

/routes
  └─ /study/[mode]/categories
  └─ /study/[mode]/category/[categoryId]/subtopics
  └─ /study/[mode]/category/[categoryId]/subtopic/[subtopicId]/questions
```

Would you like a sample code template (React + TailwindCSS) to start this flow?
