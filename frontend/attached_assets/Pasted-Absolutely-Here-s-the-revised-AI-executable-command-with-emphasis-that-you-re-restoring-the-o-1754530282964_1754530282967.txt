Absolutely. Here's the revised **AI-executable command** with emphasis that you're **restoring the original functionalities of Review, Practice, and Quiz modes — while keeping the upgraded grid-based UI flow** intact.

## ✅ AI Command – Restore Original Study Mode Functions While Retaining Upgraded Grid UI

---

### 🧩 OVERVIEW

> **Retain** the newly applied **grid-based interface and page navigation flow**,
> but **restore the original functionality** of:
>
> * **Review Mode**
> * **Practice Mode**
> * **Quiz Mode**

> The core logic and experience of each mode **must function exactly as before the UI upgrade**, applied only to the new navigation structure.

---

### 🔁 NAVIGATION FLOW

```
Study Mode (grid) → Category (grid) → Subtopic (grid) → [Mode-Specific Functionality Page]
```

---

## 🔧 MODE FUNCTIONALITIES TO RESTORE

---

### 🟦 1. REVIEW MODE

**Route:** `/study/review/category/:categoryId/subtopic/:subtopicId`

**Restore This Behavior:**

> * Display the original **review materials** for the subtopic:
>
>   * Images
>   * Explanations
> * No questions or answer inputs
> * Keep styling consistent with the upgraded grid layout

✅ This page must function as a **study-only content viewer**, just like before the UI update.

---

### 🟩 2. PRACTICE MODE

**Route:** `/study/practice/category/:categoryId/subtopic/:subtopicId`

**Restore This Behavior:**

> * Load **questions** from the selected subtopic
> * After selecting an answer:
>
>   * Indicate **correct or incorrect** via color highlight
>   * Show **explanation** below the question
> * No timer, no score tracking
> * One question shown at a time (same as before)

✅ Re-apply **original Practice Mode logic** while keeping the upgraded grid navigation.

---

### 🟥 3. QUIZ MODE

**Route:**

1. Setup: `/study/quiz/category/:categoryId/subtopic/:subtopicId/setup`
2. Quiz Start: `/study/quiz/category/:categoryId/subtopic/:subtopicId/questions`

**Restore This Behavior:**

> * After selecting a subtopic, show a **Quiz Setup Page**:
>
>   * Set number of questions
>   * Choose timer duration
>   * Select allowed skips
> * Then begin the quiz with:
>
>   * Timer
>   * Score tracking
>   * Skip logic

✅ The full **pre-UI-upgrade Quiz Mode flow** must be brought back using the new subtopic route.

---

## 🔒 Important:

> The **logic, scoring, display rules, and per-mode behavior** must remain the **same as they were before** — only the **navigation and visual layout** (grid interface and multi-page selection) have changed.
