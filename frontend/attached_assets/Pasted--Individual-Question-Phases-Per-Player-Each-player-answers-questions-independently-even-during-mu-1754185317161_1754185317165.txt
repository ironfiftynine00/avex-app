🔄 Individual Question Phases Per Player
Each player answers questions independently, even during multiplayer battle.

A player’s screen must not auto-switch to the next question just because the opponent already answered.

As long as a player has time left, they can use it without interruption.

⏱️ Timer & Question Flow Fix
Each player should only move to the next question when their own timer ends or when they click submit.

Do not auto-advance questions based on the other player’s actions.

The countdown timer must work properly and not skip to the next question early.

📊 Rankings Display
Preview Ranking: After each question, show a short animation or display showing current player rankings based on scores.

Final Ranking: After all questions are done or a player concedes, show final results and declare the winner.

Rankings should move, slide, or animate to make it exciting.

🔘 Exit / Concede Button
Add a clear “Exit / Concede” button during the quiz battle.

If a player clicks it:

Ask: “Are you sure you want to concede this match?”

If confirmed, they are removed from the match.

The opponent sees a message: “Opponent Conceded – You Win!” with a victory animation.

🎉 Battle Animations & Sounds
Add sound effects and visual animations to make it fun and competitive:

✅ Answer Selection: Play a satisfying sound and show a quick effect when an answer is selected.

⌛ Timer Warning: When time is almost up (e.g. last 5 seconds), change timer color to red, flash screen slightly, and play a countdown sound.

🔼 Ranking Movements: After each question, animate the score changes (e.g., rankings slide up/down).

🧠 Power-Ups: When using a power-up, show a cool animation and distinct sound effect based on the type (e.g., freeze timer, eliminate option, boost score).

✅ Summary for Development
Goal: Improve user experience in the quiz battle by:

Ensuring fair individual gameplay timing

Displaying real-time animated score feedback

Allowing controlled exits with proper match outcomes

Making the battle fun and exciting with sounds and animations
