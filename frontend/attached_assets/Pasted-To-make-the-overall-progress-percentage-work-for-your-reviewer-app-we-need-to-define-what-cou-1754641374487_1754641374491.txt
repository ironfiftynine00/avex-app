To make the **overall progress percentage** work for your reviewer app, we need to define **what counts as "progress"**, and **how much weight** each part of your app contributes to the total.

### ðŸ”§ BASIS FOR CALCULATION

You can track user progress **per subtopic** and then calculate the overall progress as a percentage of all subtopics completed.

Each **subtopic** can be considered "complete" if the user has:

1. âœ… Viewed the **Review** (study) materials (e.g., text/images)
2. âœ… Answered **Practice** questions
3. âœ… Taken the **Quiz**
4. âœ… Taken the **Mock Exam** (if applicable)

Letâ€™s break this down into a scoring system:

---

### âœ… SUBTOPIC PROGRESS SCORING (per subtopic)

For each subtopic, define a **completion status** like:

| Activity      | Completion Criteria                           | Weight (%) |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Review Mode   | User opened/viewed the review content         | 25%        |
| Practice Mode | User answered at least X questions            | 25%        |
| Quiz Mode     | User completed at least one quiz for subtopic | 25%        |
| Mock Exam     | Subtopic was included in a completed mock     | 25%        |

â†’ Total per subtopic = 100% if all are done.

### ðŸ“Š OVERALL PROGRESS FORMULA

```plaintext
Overall Progress (%) = 
  (Sum of all subtopic progress scores / Total number of subtopics) * 100
```

> Example: If there are 41 subtopics and a user has fully completed 20 subtopics and partially completed 5:

```plaintext
( (20 * 100%) + (5 * 50%) ) / 41 = ((2000 + 250) / 41) â‰ˆ 54.88% overall progress
```

---

### âœ… IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

1. **Track user activity** in your database per subtopic:

   * `hasViewedReview`
   * `practiceQuestionsCompleted`
   * `quizCompleted`
   * `includedInMockExamCompletion`

2. **Assign status points** as shown above.

3. **Store a `progress` field** per subtopic for each user, update when any mode is used.

4. **Calculate total average** progress across all subtopics in backend or client.

---

### ðŸ’¡ OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

* Give visual **progress bars** for each subtopic/category.
* Allow users to **see which parts are incomplete** (e.g., "You havenâ€™t taken the quiz for Nervous System").
* Display badges or streaks for completing 100% of a category.
