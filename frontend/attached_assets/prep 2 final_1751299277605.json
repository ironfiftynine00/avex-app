    "Correct Answer":"B",
    "Explanation (General)":"The center of lift is usually located slightly behind the CG of an airplane to improve longitudinal stability.|Locating the center of lift behind the CG produces a nose-heavy tendency that is balanced by the downward aerodynamic tail load.|When the nose pitches up, the aircraft slows down and the tail load decreases. Longitudinal stability causes the nose to drop back to the level flight attitude.|If the nose pitches down, the airspeed builds up and the tail load increases.

Since the signals have canceled, the autopilot does not call for any more aileron deflection.
