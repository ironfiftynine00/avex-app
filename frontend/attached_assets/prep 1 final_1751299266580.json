Fuels having a low critical pressure and temperature must not be used with high compression engines.|The design limitations of the engine are important, because engines that are not designed strong enough to withstand high cylinder pressures, must not have a high compression ratio.|The degree of supercharging is extremely important, because the cylinder pressures are a function of both the initial pressure in the cylinder (the pressure caused by the supercharger) and the compression ratio.|The only alternative that does not limit the compression ratio is the spark plug reach.",

The inertia of the exhaust gases leaving the cylinder when the intake valve opens, helps start the fresh fuel-air charge to flow into the cylinder.|By timing the valves and ignition to occur at the proper time, the mixture will not be burning as the piston is moving downward, and the cylinder walls will not become overheated.",

    "Correct Answer":"A",
    "Explanation (General)":"An oil analysis program is a trend indicating system. A sample of the oil is taken when the engine is new and the parts-per-million of each of a number of elements is recorded. As subsequent samples are tested on a regular basis, the trend of the growth of the trace elements are recorded. When the growth of any element is far more rapid than it should be, the engine operator is warned of possible impending trouble.|Analysis of the first sample is only a starting point and cannot give an accurate forecast alone.",
