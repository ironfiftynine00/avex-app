📌 TASK: Redesign ONLY the in-game battle mode of my Aircraft Maintenance Reviewer quiz app. Keep the current pre-game/lobby screen as-is. Implement the following features using modular HTML/CSS/JS (or React if already using React):


1️⃣ Interface Layout:
- Two players' names, avatars, and live score bars at the top.
- Center: Question text with 4 big answer buttons (A–D), color-coded.
- Countdown timer (15s) shown for each question.
- Bottom: Power-up bar with 5 slots (grayed out if unused).
- Auto-move to next question after both answer or timer ends.
- Instant ✓/✘ feedback after answering.


2️⃣ Gameplay Logic (like Quizizz):
- Score depends on speed:
  - <3s correct = 1000 pts
  - 3–8s = 800–400 pts
  - Wrong = 0 pts
- Lock answer when clicked.
- Show score animation between rounds.


3️⃣ Power-Ups:
- Add 5 power-ups:
  • Afterburner – +50% next correct points
  • Circuit Swap – Replace one wrong option with correct
  • Ground Fault – Scramble opponent’s answer labels
  • Double Tap – Choose 2 answers in 1 question
  • Hydraulic Boost – Instant +500 pts
- Show power-ups in bottom bar, click to activate.
- Max 5 power-ups per player, used ones turn gray.


4️⃣ Power-Up Earning System:
- Earn power-ups through:
  • 3 correct in a row → random power-up
  • 2 fast correct (<4s) → Afterburner
  • Comeback (if 2000+ pts behind, once per game) → 25% chance for power-up


🔁 Logic:

if (streak === 3) { giveRandomPowerUp(); streak = 0; }
 if (fastCorrect === 2) { givePowerUp("Afterburner"); fastCorrect = 0; }
 if (behindBy2000 && !comebackUsed) {
 if (Math.random() < 0.25) { giveRandomPowerUp(); comebackUsed = true; }
 }


5️⃣ End of Match:
- Show:
  • Total score, correct/wrong
  • Fastest answer time
  • Power-ups used
  • Winner message
- Buttons: Rematch | Return Home


6️⃣ Code Organization (Modular Required):
If Vanilla JS:

/battle-mode/
 ├── battle-game.html
 ├── battle-style.css
 ├── battle-logic.js
 ├── powerups.js
 ├── ui.js


If React:

/src/components/
 ├── BattleGame.jsx
 ├── QuestionCard.jsx
 ├── PowerUps.jsx
 ├── ScoreBar.jsx


7️⃣ Visual Style:
- Aviation theme: blue/orange, gauges, metallic buttons
- Optional: add sound effects (boost, click, buzzer)


⚠️ DO NOT change any lobby/start screen code. Only modify the game question/battle interface.


🎯 GOAL: Make the in-game quiz feel fast, competitive, and reward smart + fast answers with power-ups. Follow Quizizz-style flow.
