RAILWAY ZERO-CONFIG DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
=====================================

This package is optimized for Railway's zero-config deployment in 2025.

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. Upload this entire folder to Railway (no config files needed)
2. Set these environment variables in Railway Dashboard:

   DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-connection-string
   SESSION_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret  
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key

3. Deploy!

WHAT CHANGED:
- No railway.json file (Railway auto-detects Node.js)
- Simple "start" script using tsx directly
- tsx moved to dependencies (needed in production)
- Uses process.env.PORT (Railway requirement)

Railway automatically:
- Detects Node.js via package.json
- Runs "npm install"
- Executes "npm start"
- Assigns SSL certificate
- Provides public URL

If deployment still fails, try:
- Check Railway logs for specific errors
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Verify DATABASE_URL connects to your PostgreSQL database
